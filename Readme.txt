
a) The top level script is main.m . The other scripts used are DLS,jacobian and fk ( forward kinematics).
The other two are given which are used for plotting results and checking angles.


b) Implementing jacobian and DLS was at first a difficult task. 


c)This project helped us a lot in understanding all the theoretical concepts taught in the class by actually
seeing it.This helped us in understanding where we can apply all the thoeries in practise. Maybe in future 
this project should be implemented in a mini robotic arm than a simulator.
